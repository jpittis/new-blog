      <description>With the release of toxiproxy-haskell on Hackage, I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce the Haskell community to failure testing using Toxiproxy so that they can improve the resilience of their network connected applications.
Toxiproxy Toxiproxy is a cross platform TCP proxy that lets you simulate latency, timeouts, rejections and other network conditions in your test and development environments.
I think the best way to explain how Toxiproxy works is through an example.</description>
